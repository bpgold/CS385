/**
 * What is a brute force algorithm?
 *
 * A brute force algorithm is one that tests all possible candidates
 * for meeting a certain criterion.
 *
 * It is not necessarily the best algorithm but is often the simplest one
 * and often works well enough for small input sizes.
 * It's tied closely to the concept of exhaustive search.
 *
 * Nearest-neighbor problem:
 *
 * x
 *                     x
 *                             x
 *                         x
 *                                                x
 *                  x
 *     x
 *                                         x
 *
 * Imagine each x represents the GPS coordinates of a person. We want to
 * find the 2 people who are closest to one another.
